          <h3>Autistic Acceptance</h3>
          <p>My website will discuss discrimination, both interpersonal and institutionalized, against autistic people.</p>
          <h3>Why Does This Matter?</h3>
          <p>Autistic people are valuable members of society just like anyone else, and because their minds think differently, they can be extremely creative. Nonverbal autistic people are still capable of
          communication given the proper tools. However, society harbors immense prejudice against autistic (and all disabled) individuals, preventing them from thriving.</p>
          <h3>How it Affects Autistic People</h3>
          <ul>
          <li>Autistic people are often infantilized, especially if they are nonverbal. Additionally, autism is associated so heavily with children that autistic adults are presumed to not exist.</li>
          <li>Autistic people are denied accomodations and tools that would allow them to thrive.</li>
          <li>Autistic children are more frequently restrained by school staff and bullied by classmates. Violence and bullying on the basis of disability are not only illegal, but highly traumatic.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>How to be an Ally</h3>
          <ul>
          <li>PRESUME COMPETENCE!! Assume autistic people are capable of learning and comprehension, even when there is no visible evidence</li>
          <li>Support autistic self-advocacy</li>
          <li>Many autistic people are prone to sensory overload. Design for accessibility and clarity.</li>
          </ul>
          <hr>
          <h3>Process</h3>
          <p>I chose autism acceptance as my topic because I myself an autistic. As I've grown up with this condition, there have been many misconceptions and prejudices that lowered my confidence in myself.</p>
          <p>I chose to incorporate red into my webpage as a homage to the growing "Red Instead" movement, the autistic community's counter to Autism Speaks' "Light it Up Blue" proclamation. Autism Speaks is detested by the autistic community due to its history of treating autism as a "disease" and attempting to find a "cure", as well as using very little of its profits to help actual autistic people.
          <p>I divided each section by placing each in a light red box. I thought it would increase the clarity by making each section distinct. I made the text relatively large so it would be accessible and mobile-friendly.</p>
          <p>I used the following principles from Don't Make Me Think:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Omit needless words</li>
            <li>Mobile: Itâ€™s not just a city in Alabama anymore</li>
            <li>Accessibility and you</li>
          </ul>
          <hr>
          <p>
